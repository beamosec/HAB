# HAB CVCC 2017
High Altitude Balloon project, funded by NASA and the North Carolina Space Balloon Project.

## What is it?
Participating with other local colleges, we hook up arduino sensors, cameras, and amatuer radio technology to a payload and connect it to a
balloon. We expect it to go up 15-20 miles into the atmosphere and parachute back down to us.
